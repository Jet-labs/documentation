# Queries
-------------------------
Postgres queries can be saved as variables which when used will be executed in run-time. Output can be checked by testing the query

#### **Using queries variables**

- **Referencing queries inside other queries:** Query values can be used in run-time inside another query by utilizing the syntax below:
  ```sql
  select * from city where city_id={{[pm_query_id:21][0].city_id]};
  ```
    - `{{}}` is used to utilize the variable
    - `[]` is used to define the `pm_query_id` of desired query
      
- **Using app constants inside query**

  ```sql
  select * from city where city_id={{[pm_query_id:22][[pm_query_id:35][0].city_id].city_id}}
  or city_id={{[pm_app_constant_id:4].value}};
  ```
- **Using arguments inside query**

  ```sql
  select * from city where city_id={{arg1}} or city_id={{arg2}};
  ```
